<h1 id="timeline-mindset-trajectory-harm">timeline, mindset, trajectory, harm:</h1>

<p>I’ve rewritten the below a few times. It still feels like a very early draft, and it could be rewritten one hundred more times.</p>

<h1 id="raw-hours">raw hours:</h1>

<p>So there’s this partially open-ended thing that you can do with the bodymind. And it takes time, thousands of hours. There’s a part that can’t be compressed, sort of the raw thing you’re working with, the way your mind <em>is,</em> right now, in all its complexity, that has to be worked all the way through. And then there will be contingent things that will make all of that go faster or slower.</p>

<p>If someone is older, they’ll have more raw stuff to work through. [The following sentence is long and hard to parse, and I apologize.] I suspect, for, say, someone who’s, I don’t know, between eighteen and thirty years old, with no really perverse trauma that can confusingly mix good and bad together, for example childhood sexual abuse, who’s really good with working with documents and a teacher, <em>maybe</em> they could start to asymptote around 6000 hours. Maybe. There are still unknowns, here. I suspect something more realistic, for someone between eighteen and forty-five, is anywhere from 8000-12,000 hours. Maybe!</p>

<p>Every problem you encounter may seem like it’s the deepest last problem. But there will be another, and another, maybe with a delay but inevitably, until there isn’t. So plan for this, in resources (time, money, relationships), possible break-taking (to make money or friends), opportunity costs, etc. One can’t predict using timelines, or plan using timelines—one has to just assume it’s going to take 10 years 20 years even if it only takes 1.7 years. This can potentially be hard and risky, depending on available resources and opportunity costs, and likely or possible sequelae. This paragraph will be at the end of the next section as well.</p>

<p>I sometimes say that all of this, for some degree of “asymptotic done-ness,” with optional plenty more to do, across a lifetime, takes roughly, on the order of, 10,000 hours.</p>

<p>Below is a discussion of the use of the number “10,000.”</p>

<p>[…]</p>

<p>Mark:</p>

<p>the “[10,000] hours” thing may end up being problematic for a lot of people. [i do think it’s a pretty good rough estimate; i chose that number carefully and i’m tracking data, as it comes in, to see if that estimate should be updated, and/but,] i just wanted to convey something about the seriousness of the investment, how long bad patches can be, and how counterintuitively long it can take to get certain benefits.</p>

<p>but like if people don’t meditate while falling asleep or waking up bc it’s hard to start and stop a timer, ahhhh. all sorts of goodharty stuff is possible, leading to too much grindy meditation and too little ad hoc meditation</p>

<p>collaborator1:</p>

<p>I also recently found the 10k number VERY helpful to get oriented (see “in an hour maybe you can cover 1% of 1%”) so for me “Estimating” to get a sense of scale seems good for me right now, and “Tracking” seems hilariously bad</p>

<p>collaborator2:</p>

<p>@collaborator1 the 1% of 1% thing as expectation management and setting small goals / making sure I am not pushing too hard has been super helpful to me.</p>

<p>collaborator1:</p>

<p>!! Right: although they superficially seem the same (pointing at the scale of the endeavor) there is a huuuuuuuge difference in flavor between “in a given hour I can expect to cover 1% of 1% of what’s down there” versus “oof, lotta hours, gotta start churning them out - gotta do more hours”</p>

<p>The former encourages me to “push” or “force” a LOT less, to be WAY more patient</p>

<p>The latter makes me impatient</p>

<p>“This is a slow, gentle unfolding. It thrives when given breathing room, time, and space” versus “This is gonna be a herculean raw accumulation of effort.”</p>

<p>“I am going to a meditation retreat so I can put in a bunch more hours” (latter) vs “I am going on retreat so I can give this process so much slack, so little pressure; allow it to bloom, to rest, to unfurl into the time abundance”</p>

<p>… I think this mood more or less is my practice, right now. The entirety of it</p>

<p>[…]</p>

<p>collaborator1:</p>

<p>Mooore musingssssss. Given that the timescale is “in” the state of the system (how tangled it is), and it “wants” to unfurl, my job is to make space where it could unfurl</p>

<p>So I win every time I clear space and time where I could meditate or whatever</p>

<p>Every time I’m not enforcing some constraint that’s incompatible with doing a little bit of untangling/unfurling right then</p>

<p>Even if I - even if “the system” - chooses to do “something else” with that time/space (edited)</p>

<p>Sometimes I end up going kinda deep on some interospective sifting, but sometimes I end up doing art or cleaning or something, that’s all good</p>

<p>[…]</p>

<p>collaborator3:</p>

<p>What’s the benefit of keeping track of how long you meditate for?</p>

<p>How is it not just an overhead?</p>

<p>Does it help anything? (aside from research, e.g. Mark would want to estimate how long it might take for the sake of people adopting his approach)</p>

<p>Mark:</p>

<p>for me, as a very, very rough guide of “where one is at” so it doesn’t feel like a vague infinity. it matters less if someone can “just tell” the time spent is good and valuable, but, even then, a very rough hour guesstimate can help someone gently persevere when/if things sometimes feel endlessly hard.</p>

<p>with current data [2020-12-03], “10k hours” seems like a good heuristic for a “first-pass tour of all the possible surprises and neat/terrible stuff before things mostly ongoingly chill out”</p>

<p>a GENTLE, loosely held, completionism thing, I think, can help, too, hour count-wise, if it doesn’t become goodhart-y and grind-y, for people who are particularly interested in “going all the way,” for whatever that individually means to them. though whatever that means to them, individually, could come in/”finish” way under or over 10,000 hours. (and, 10k or not, in any case, some people, long-run, will be doing things across a lifetime, along a complex spectrum of priority and investment.)</p>

<p>[end discussion]</p>

<h1 id="better-to-finish-and-smoothly">better to finish, and smoothly:</h1>

<p>[editing note: noting that the discussion just added above maybe confusingly tone clashes with this section]</p>

<p>One of the things that’s hard is that, I suspect, for most people, doing the thing will either consume their lives or they’ll get stuck. There’s the saying, “Better not to start. If you start, better to finish.”</p>

<p>Some people will try to fit all this into the way their life currently is, their job, their relationships. That might work, meditating one to three hours per day, with more on the weekends, and intensely a few times per year. (But, again, see above how long that’ll take, calendar time, given the raw number of hours needed to asymptote.) One possible outcome of this is that they won’t notice many things changing. And that’s a safe tolerable outcome. But, if that person gets into some hard stuff, they might not have the “habitual intensity” to get themselves out. And they may get stuck in a state that’s hurting themselves, people they care about, and possibly many people that they incidentally come into contact with in their daily lives.</p>

<p>So there’s a certain safety in “really committing.” You <em>don’t</em> have to do that in the beginning. You <em>can</em> ramp up slowly over six to twenty-four months, maybe, to see if you really want to do this thing. Maybe. We don’t have enough data, yet. This section will change as that data comes in. Be very careful about experimenting, to figure out whether you’re in or you’re out. Don’t accidentally get too far. It happens.</p>

<p>An important part of the that “really committing” is not just knowing that you’re going to put in a lot of hours. That other part is something like “cognitive burden” or “cognitive momentum.” It often or even usually won’t look like normal “figuring things out,” though it very well might, but your mind is going to be occupied solving problems of types its never, ever had to solve before. And, to make progress, this is sometimes going to be going on “in the back of your mind” when you’d potentially rather be, say, making money or enjoying or strengthening relationships. One person described it to be as “whole self demanding” as another full time job or another primary relationship. So, even if one doesn’t meditate for three days or something, that “job-ness” or “relationship-ness” in terms of how the mind is processing beneath the surface (or not) doesn’t go away.</p>

<p>A few paragraphs above, I mentioned, “they may get stuck in a state that’s hurting themselves, people they care about, and possibly many people that they incidentally come into contact with in their daily lives.” Being “really committed” also involves trying to have life flexibility to sometimes dial the intensity up even more, to move through harmful states faster or more smoothly. Other sections will talk a bit more specifically about the possible harms to oneself and other people. But, if something like that is going on, one wants to be able to ideally isolate themselves for as many hours or days is necessary to get to something better. That’s going to put a strain on relationships, depending on how complete that isolation should be. It’s better to have kids after one or both people get on the likely far side of all of that.</p>

<p>This paragraph is in the section above, too: Every problem you encounter may seem like it’s the deepest last problem. But there will be another, and another, maybe with a delay but inevitably, until there isn’t. So plan for this, in resources (time, money, relationships), possible break-taking (to make money or friends), opportunity costs, etc. One can’t predict using timelines, or plan using timelines—one has to just assume it’s going to take 10 years 20 years even if it only takes 1.7 years. This can potentially be hard and risky, depending on available resources and opportunity costs, and likely or possible sequelae.</p>

<h1 id="a-failure-mode">a failure mode:</h1>

<p>I’ve talked above about “intensity” and “really committing,” but this can lead people into a very common failure mode. So this might be one of the most important subsections you’ll read in this entire document.</p>

<p>When people first start using this material, they might do a thing that could be called any of the things below:</p>

<p>magical button-pushing<br />
excessive-faith meditation<br />
superstitious meditation<br />
“meditate-and-pray”</p>

<p>What these mean, and they all refer to the same thing, is to sort of be doing one’s best to follow the instructions maybe to the letter, but not trying to understand and enact the instructions to their very essence or core. Even if one is using the meta protocol, and the meta meta protocol, one can still be doing something like this.</p>

<p>It’s better to maybe pretend that the instructions are complete shit, a lossy telephone game, that’s pointing at a real thing (or is it), but something got hopelessly garbled. And, you want the value, but you should then interact with the instructions with the intention to find “the real instructions behind the instructions.” This isn’t a new idea. But, even where some parts of this document are vague, some parts are crystal clear (in some sense), albeit hard to parse or initially interpret. And that (arguable) clarity can make it seem like “all one has to do is follow the instructions,” which just isn’t true.</p>

<p>I tell people they would ideally create their own instruction document, that leaves out none of the essential complexity that this document is pointing to, but is entirely in their own words…</p>

<p>Without this section, I think the written instructions do eventually lead people to the “real instructions,” but hopefully reading this will make that go faster.</p>

<p>I want to emphasize, though, that ALMOST EVERYONE inevitably starts with magical button-pushing. One shouldn’t be ashamed of this. Some percentage of people just won’t be able to help themselves. Not-being-able-to-help-it, to not do it, of course, is why we meditate in the first place. Finding one’s way to the real instructions, over tens or hundreds of hours, is just part of the thing.</p>

<p>Be precise, patient, and gentle.</p>

<h1 id="meditation-is-not-strength-training">meditation is not strength-training:</h1>

<p>[Originally published: https://meditationstuff.wordpress.com/2020/01/20/meditation-is-not-strength-training/ (Last accessed: 2020-09-06)]</p>

<p>I think the repetition/strength-training/functional-reserve model of meditation is pretty misleading. The mind isn’t a muscle. It’s better to think of it as a digital state machine that can self-modify its state transition function, even though this borrows from the dubious computing metaphor. The mind is not analog and not mushy. It is shockingly digital and lossless. Seeming muscle-ness is an abstraction on more fine-grain dynamics. To succeed, one must eventually engage with those dynamics as they are (of course, but models matter). “Strength training” causes people to accumulate a great deal of momentum and cruft that they then have to reverse and undo. I’ve heard stories of people who wish they’d had a better sense of “right effort,” earlier on.* I personally think it’s better to think in terms of puzzle-solving, test-check, and wayfinding right from the start.</p>

<p>An analogy I use is that the mind is made of a tangle of perfectly flexible, perfectly fluid steel cables that are also perfectly incompressible and inelastic. Maybe like cooked spaghetti or heavy rope, but “indestructible” or “unforgiving.” And you can reweave the cables but nothing can be created or destroyed. (This isn’t entirely true because experience tangles in new cable(s) and correct reweavings cause cables to losslessly become one [“elegance collapse”].] No escape but ultimately clear directionality in the space of play.</p>

<p>I think Donald Knuth has an essay somewhere about programming. And he makes an analogy that, when people first start learning programming, they think it’s like drawing, where, if you push harder with the pencil you get a darker line. I <em>think</em> the more recent idea of “programming by coincidence” is downstream of this essay. I don’t agree with everything in the essay, if I remember it correctly, but some of the metaphorical/analogical distinctions are great.</p>

<p>Yes, experimenting, yes playing, yes <em>learning</em>. But not guessing and hoping, or doubling-down, over and over again!</p>

<p>To back off a little bit, there is something to the “train the microscope then use the microscope.” There is “gathering” of content and method, over and over again. Behavior is, if not digital, then coherent–walking and talking and eating. Some behaviors are digital-ish, like speaking or writing, though they are waves in a preconceptual/postconceptual ocean. And/but/then/anyway it’s like the insights, the microscope(s), get perpetually rewoven through the entire system, while the system retains something of their character. This isn’t quite right, but I think it’s better than the strength-training analogy.</p>

<p>To back off a little bit more, I can imagine the strength-training analogy can be empowering and is a better model than “hapless, hopeless prisoner/captive of one’s own uncontrollable mind”!</p>

<p>But mind as collaborative puzzle-solving coconspirator (albeit with potentially miles and miles of terrible, torturous, self-reflexive, strange-loop confusion) might be better.</p>

<p>*Of the people in the wild who have succeeded or seem to be making inexorable progress, it does seem that “overshooting and correcting” does work. And the more likely failure mode is “not reaching escape velocity.” But, I think explicit wayfinding might be best thing. Not enough theory/data, yet. And, I don’t know how much selection bias is in my (contemporary) “historical” data.</p>

<h1 id="entrenchment-and-active-occlusion-layering-shoulds-pitfalls-of-inferred-mental-actions">entrenchment and active occlusion (layering); shoulds; pitfalls of inferred “mental actions”:</h1>

<p>Along with “intensity” and “really commiting” and “magical button-pushing,” is sort of “creeping unreflective desperation and unresponsiveness.” Often we start meditating because, whether we can put our finger on it or not, something is terrible, horrific somewhere. There is something really, really, really, really bad. And, the first impulse of the mind, in some sense, once the mind gets just enough knowledge to start making changes to itself, is to reflexively, in some sense, run as far away from the bad thing as it possibly can.</p>

<p>And that running away, paradoxicaly, tragically is exactly the wrong thing that ultimately needs to happen. (That’s often the case but not always. Sometimes the “running away” is the only way the mind can pick up tools to finally turn around and come back.</p>

<p>In any case, whether it’s good or bad, that running away will sometimes freeze not just that deep dark bad thing (or, usually, a bunch of deep, dark bad things) but will “freeze” a whole bunch of other things as well.</p>

<p>That is, a meditator can become more rigid, more neurotic, more belligerent, more unresponsive, more “unspiritual” before things turn around. And some of that rigidity might not go away for until the meditator is close to the “very end.” Or it’ll painfully come and go in ways that are distressing to both the meditator and the people around them, hopes and expectations dashed, over and over again.</p>

<p>So, this section is both for caution and expectation setting but also to possibly make it a bit less likely that something like this will happen. Judicious use of the meta protocol and the meta meta protocol will help.</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>Another way to look at all this is, at a very different level of abstraction, “don’t even try to make yourself a certain, very specific way. And, even more so, don’t ever try to move forward without understanding why you’re not already that way.” Beware, beware, “I <em>should</em> just be able to do X…”</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>It might be helpful to explore further where some “shoulds” partially even come from. This is one possibility:</p>

<p>We model what we “should” be able to do, now or eventually, in part based on observations of other people, especially people that we sort of tag as “peers.”</p>

<p>One issue with this is that we sometimes then “[…] compare our behind-the-scenes with everyone else’s highlight reel” (attributed to Steve Furtick?), and the discussion below applies a bunch to this as well.</p>

<p>But, what I want to focus on is something like “inferred ‘mental actions’” (both the whole thing and the subphrase ‘mental actions’ each have quotes around them).</p>

<p>So what happen is that we don’t just emulate other people’s overt behavior and routines, as best we can figure out what those are, such as their workout habits, practice habits, apparent uses of “reasoning” or “logic,” their athletic, artistic, or musical form, etc., but we might also infer sort of “what they’re doing with their mind,” and then we try to do that too. (Of course, in a bunch of senses, there isn’t real “mind” or even “bodymind”, cf. “no mind anywhere,” etc., etc., etc., and that indeed is part of the problem, too.)</p>

<p>So, we sort of pair external and internal actions, in mimicry of people around us. Sometimes this works great! But in general it’s very difficult to know what other people are “doing” with their “minds,” and there are even /some/ senses in which this isn’t even possible. And/but, even if we <em>could</em>know what they’re doing, it often won’t be right for us.</p>

<p>–oh, all things being equal, experts probably are doing similar things with their minds (See Herbert Simon’s Protocol Analysis!), and, indeed, world class performers (and often mediate performs) are probably using sort of the same brain networks–</p>

<p>But people usually don’t start out that way. Trying to do expert-y things or peer things, right off the bat, or ever (depending on initial interpretation!) might not mesh well with the “regime” one’s mind is currently in! It’s not just that language, at the very very very least for beginning meditators, is sort of seated differently for everyone, and we interpret language use differently, sometimes wildly differently (say when we’re not just inferring, but someone even describes what they’re doing, explicitly or implying, and we try to do the same), but that, sort of, to a first approximation, “everything” is seated differently between different people. Everyone is sort of running their own constellation of “(embodied) (body)mind functions.” And/but, of course, of course, there are “supervenient” or “supervening” isomorphisms and homomorphisms between people, especially amongst peers, and within cultures, and within workplaces!!! But, sort of, the underlying “layering structure” is often different, the “sub-functions” are often different(, the “concepts” are often different), the precise, dynamic constellation of brain network/substrate is often different, and so on. I’m maybe actually overstating it a bit; there’s actually quite a bit of convergence in how people “use their brains,” say if you look at a bunch of right-handed males of the same age who all speak the same language, for various tasks (and so on), with fMRI or EEG or something. Tons of phenotypic homology leading to “functional homology.” But there’s also plenty of divergence, too. There’s still lots of software divergence on top of that hardware, and there’s often at least a little (genetic and developmental) hardware divergence, too, or a lot.</p>

<p>People who have some especially non-normative very-soon-after-the-first-moments-of-consciousness “first concepts” or people who have subtle or not-so-subtle neurological divergence, are maybe often going to have a bad time trying to emulate people as children, tweens, teens, and adults for at least some narrow set of things that would otherwise make use of what in this case is non-normative sub-functions or “substrate.” In the former case, when it’s “just” software, then that’s sort of, for better and worse, “fixable” (bad choice of words), I think, with the usual… ten thousand hours of meditation. With neurological divergence, I think, it might <em>sometimes</em> be hard to ultimately do some synergistic collections of things that some people to be able to seamlessly do (like someone who is good at a bunch of sports)–a person with some non-normativity might (initially painstakingly) indeed get to the point of costless, effortless skill (that, too, doesn’t interfere with other skills) with one sport but not have a lot of tranfer to other sports, or something.</p>

<p>But, at least at first, often, something is not “going the same way” as it does for lots of other people. And where things can go unfortunately worse is when someone “doubles down” on, potentially conceptually ill-posed, inferred mental actions. And then if one doesn’t seem to be getting the same result (even when sometimes all that’s needed is patience), that can lead to “shoulding,” as in, “this <em>should</em> work!”</p>

<p>And that can potentially lead to forcing and self-hatred strategies that can get really layered in. But of course these-all can also be undone, with time! But it can get very compounding; layers on layers with possible mostly normal “phenotype” at the bottom or something more neurologically divergent, sometimes.</p>

<p>But in any case, even in cases of “divergence,” as best I can tell, “buddha mind” still applies, meaning self-acceptance, structural fluidity, etc., etc., etc., etc., is fully available. “It won’t be the life you ‘thought you wanted’ but it will be fully retrospectively be the life you do want, or that frame will be completely dissolved.” Sometimes it might be a bit of a longer road, though, because a greater likelihood of lots of “switchback layering.” That said, for better and worse, I think such people are often more likely to both pick up meditation and then take it all the way. Opportunity costs, there, but also extraordinarily good stuff that lots of people wouldn’t otherwise get to experience and live.</p>

<p>So again, incongruence / incongruity between sort of one’s own subtrate or regime, with respect to what one is cueing off of other people, can lead to compounding layering with potentially shoulding, leading to forcing and self-hatred.</p>

<p>As a first pass, one might explore what “mental actions” they’re inferring off of their interpretations of “what other people are doing” and whether that is potentially really gumming things up. This will generally help a little bit also be sort of “out of order” for most people because of how deep this stuff can go.</p>

<p>Ultimately, one will sort of deconstruct “mental,” “action,” “other people,” etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., undo layering, find bottom-up strategies with respect to pursuit of settled-but-fluid, non-fixed goals, which will synergize with more and more self-acceptance, self-care, more strategic “inner” and “outer” behavior, and so on. And perhaps most importantly, one will have increasing self-knowledge, to better evaluate the usefulness of other people’s provisionally inferred strategies and to better be able to immediately and fluidly begin to adapt them or discard them with respect to one’s own situation.</p>

<p>[Note: I’m unhappy with some of the vibe and deep conceptual stuff in this sub-section.]</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>Again, be precise, patient, and gentle.</p>

<p>It can be helpful to realize that you need to become a genius. You need to become brilliant. You will become brilliant, at least along some narrow dimensions, in the course of doing this thing. If you strive for that, relax into it, things will go more smoothly.</p>

<p>The level of skill and (mostly implicit) intricate knowledge that you need to acquire is shockingly high. It’s like you need to learn every single instrument in an entire orchestra, including the ones that, at least historically, very rarely get used, as well as how to be a conductor. But that’s what the protocol is for. The protocol helps you do that. But if you’re ready for that, you know what’s supposed to happen, then that can go more eaily.</p>

<p>Additionally, it can help to reach for words, phrases, and concepts like these:</p>

<ul>
  <li>comprehensiveness</li>
  <li>systematicity</li>
  <li>exhaustivity</li>
  <li>flawlessness</li>
  <li>perfection</li>
  <li>no shims, no patches, nothing left behind, no subtle errors, no subtle jogs or * discontinuities or shear</li>
  <li>no stuff hidden under apparent flawlessness or smoothness</li>
  <li>no stable bypass, nothing left behind, no shortcuts</li>
</ul>

<p>[And eventually you will let go of the above! Perfection-in-imperfection type stuff, aconceptual and post-conceptual type stuff. Letting go of “done” and “done-ness” and “finished” and “end” and “completion,” etc.]</p>

<p>[No-goal, no-plan, no-view, no-position, no-escape, no-refuge, no-end, no-next, no-later, no-elsewhere, no-elsewhen, no-success, no-failure, no-purpose, no-point, no-good[~], no-bad[~], no-evil, no-self, no-choice, no-stability, no-completion, no-path, no-fruit, no-refuge, nothing-to-do, nothing-to-hold-on-to, no-stability, no-foothold, no-bootstrap, nondual, not-two, not-one…][no old life to get back to, no “getting back to it” [afterwards], no elsewhere, no other place, no world out there, no people, no hope, no fear, no remainder, nothing left over, no permanence, no refuge, no foothold, no fixing/stilling, no depending, nothing waiting for you [to finish], no fact of the matter, nowhere to run, nowhere to hide]</p>

<p>That is, it can be helpful to realize, at the finest grain, there’s no vagueness, no “mush,” no “slop.” The mind, in some sense, is shockingly lossless. Like, there’s compression, to be sure, but that compression is shockingly lossless.</p>

<p>You might think of the mind as made up of incompressible, inelastic, lossless, indestructible steel cables that are all very long and tangled together. And you need to untangle them and thread one-hundred percent of them all the way through their individual needle holes. And because of the nature of those cables it’s simply impossible to cheat.</p>

<p>Or, you might think of the mind is made up of one’s and zero’s, like a computer program or something. (And, luckily, there’s tons of parity checking.) And, by the time you’re finished, not even a single bit can be wrong. No bits left behind, not a single one.</p>

<p>You don’t have to be stressed about this, in the sense that the mind is going to lead you to all those needed untwists or bits left behind. In some sense, which is part of the whole point, the mind isn’t going to let you half-ass anything. That’s not how the mind works.</p>

<p>But the main point is that, the more you go with the grain of this, the more smoothly it will go. There’s a right ordering to everything, to be sure. And sometimes it’s going to suck.</p>

<p>But, if you know that you might indeed need sometimes spend five hundred hours going after one “bit,” and indeed you might need to do that twenty times, that’s just part of the practice. That <em>is</em> the practice.</p>

<p>Again, the protocol will lead you to this level of conscientiousness and skill. The protocol (and the meta protocol and the meta meta protocol) and how the mind responds will lead you to find every last one of those bits, in some sense won’t let you do anything less, will help you be sure you’ve got them all. You’ll eventually get a taste for perfection, flawlessness, etc.</p>

<p>You’ll learn how to work at the finest grain. You’ll learn how to act with continuity, continuousness, without inappropriate gaps, jumps, jogs.</p>

<p>The protocol might start out feeling super clunky, not like meditation at all. But, over time, bottom up, it’ll look more and more like “classical contemporary noting” [sic] and concentration without support.</p>

<p>Go with the grain of this, not against it.</p>

<h1 id="physical-sequelae">physical sequelae:</h1>

<p>If you start inclining towards the very faintest beginnings of crippling muscle tension, nerve root impingement, intracranial pressure, intraocular pressure, then you’ve left something out. There’s a memory or a “bit” missing, somewhere. Engage the meta protocol and meta meta protocol and the preliminary/auxilliary practices and outside resources, if necessary, to go and find it. Ideally, do these things long before there’s even the faintest hint of muscle tension, etc. It’s much, much easier for any of that to creep up on you than it is to dispel it.</p>

<h1 id="the-end-of-your-world-after-adyashanti-maybe">the end of your world (after adyashanti, maybe?):</h1>

<p>Along with that extreme skill and extreme standards, there’s also something needed like courage or bravery.</p>

<p>In some sense, everything you thought you knew about everything is going to be wrong. Things are going to seem pretty normal on the far end, but, holy shit, in the middle, sometimes.</p>

<p>Your deepest assumptions are going to be questioned, and you’re likely going be absolutely shocked, at least a few times.</p>

<p>And some things are going to creepingly seem like horrible, horrible, intolerable “truths” at least at first. Or you’re eventually realize you’re mistaken, or you’ll eventually realize it’s not actually that bad.</p>

<p>But, there’s probably going to be away in which “everything is taken from you,” sometimes figuratively or at least psychologically (or even spiritually; or even literally, if understandably but tragically parts of your life get fucked up).</p>

<p>Bravery. Courage.</p>

<h1 id="drama">drama</h1>

<p>Beware of decompensated impulsiveness. Don’t cheat on your significant other. Don’t blow up at your friends. Don’t create situations where you need to be saved. Don’t be dramatic. And/but, be exactly as dramatic as you need to be but no more.</p>

<h1 id="error-propagation-wayfinding-grace-of-what-minds-are">error propagation, wayfinding, grace of what minds are:</h1>

<p>Holy shit, a lot of warnings here, about things that can go wrong. It’s important to keep in mind, and this has been a lifeline for me, and it’s true, the mind is ultimately reversible. Any “mistake” or mistake the mind has made, whether it was in the first moments of consciousness or a dumbass (as it were; or completely innocent) thing you were doing for <em>two thousand hours</em> in the course of meditation. The mind will ultimately untwist its way to that thing, raise that thing, backchain all the necessary prerequisites, complete those, and then correct the thing. And that’s whether you’re eighteen or ninety. All you need to do is practice correctly, to responsively, methodically, intelligently, intuitive crank. Meditation works because this is what minds are. This is what minds do and this is what meditation does and that’s why we’re doing it.</p>

<p>Error propagation, meditating (or just living) in a way that incidentally or systematically spreads and ramifies errors throughout mind, experience, and behavior is just a thing.</p>

<p>But meditation is also systematic error-correction, problem-solving and backtracking.</p>

<p>Meditation is global wayfinding.</p>

<p>Meditation is not, say, “strength training” or a “faith exercise” (although surrender and faith play a part).</p>

<p>Meditation is unlocking an intricate puzzle box.</p>

<p>Meditation is global wayfinding.</p>

<p>Meditation is wayfinding.</p>

<h1 id="on-good-and-bad-draft">on good and bad [draft]:</h1>

<p>The words “good” and “bad” are used a lot throughout this document. In some sense, the entire document is built around these words–and, of course, not just the words, but what they might <em>mean</em>, loosely held.</p>

<p>But what <em>do</em> they mean, in this context? And why words with such baggage, such laden connotations (sometimes religious, moral, parental, self-policing, etc.)?</p>

<p>The words “good” and “bad” were chosen, because, even though their <em>connotations</em> are problematic, most all other words that were considered didn’t have quite the right <em>denotations</em>.</p>

<p>A few words that were considered for “good”: valued, useful, wholesome, skillful, wise… You could probably come up with a few much better ones, but, for my part at least, none of them really captured the sense that I was looking for. I even considered using (nonce? neologism? slang?) words like “yay” and “bleh” in place of “good” and “bad.”</p>

<p>But, ultimately, by “good” I just mean good. And by “bad” I just mean bad. By dropping the quotes in that previous sentence, I just did a particularly language-y thing, like I’m pointing to one specific there, <em>there</em>. Am I? Is there?</p>

<p>So, yeah, by dropping the quotes, that’s not to essentialize or eternalize good and bad, to fix and crystalize their meanings, to point at something enduringly real or existing, to point to them as something outside of you, or something eternal and authoritative. But that’s not to say that they don’t mean <em>anything</em> either, that it’s all <em>meaningless</em> or nothing or nihilism, that there isn’t <em>anything</em> there. No no, on the contrary, “goodness”/goodness in particular can be an incredibly powerful concept (not to inappropriately reify <em>concepts</em> as such, either–and it’s less: “concepts”–and more: “the very transparently, seamlessly appearing being and seeming of the world, through and through, without remainder). And, regarding that “power,” not the least of which because of the perhaps singular way it can keep pace with a person’s untwisting and untangling. Wrestling with “goodness” (“true goodness,” “actual goodness,” “really real goodness”–not to inappropriately reify “true” and “actual” and “really real” is perhaps singularly productive. Maybe. Another way to put it, and this is problematic too, is “what do I actually really truly all the way down wholeheartedly, heartfelty want just because I want it? Kind of, sort of.</p>

<p>What I’m pointing at, too, here, is something like,</p>

<p>“nth-order consequentialism across all time horizons, immediate, imminent, proximal, distal, and everything between, before, during, and after” (not to inappropriately reify TIME, eternity, sempiternity, now, anything–this is just a schema, just words)</p>

<p>That was a messy mouthful. Slightly shorter is “nth-order consequentialism across all time horizons.” This is just my gloss, my handle.</p>

<p>(Added later: Consequentialism that understands nth-order effects of means (i.e. the ends “justify” the means only if you take into account all the ends of all the means // if you think that’s impossible do note that you’re already imperfectly doing it as the basis of all your behavior! and one can come to do it better over time, which is wisdom // this post brought to you by my being upset at how the word consequentialism is getting thrown around atm. also i am not a moral/ethical scholar though // “that you’re already imperfectly doing it as the basis of all your behavior” this phrase should be taken as shitpost-grade. // hmm, there’s a causality/​telicity equivocation in here // More discussion, here, including replies: https://twitter.com/meditationstuff/status/1592974670894026752 [Last accessed: 2022-11-21] // Anyway, I’m trying to point at something like knowing the consequences of one’s behavior, including such that there are “no” unaccounted-for externalities (up to “true” phenomenological-edge-and-beyond unknown unknowns), at all time horizons from immediate to “???” (impermanence / non-eternity applies) and this takes durational time but is simultaneous costless, effortless, etc., and even all this eats itself with no remainder in spontaneity, etc. So maybe consequentialism is a misnomer or at least has problematic connotations, because far from “the ends justify the means” I’m saying the exact opposite of that…. e.g. even things even that “no one will ever find out” still have karmic effects in the (body)mindscape sense, but nor am I saying be rule-bound or scrupulous, and so on, and so on.)</p>

<p>To say more, it’s something like, just, given <em>this</em>, in front of me, what’s <em>going</em> to happen, “<em>exactly</em>” what’s going to happen (holding that loosely, not clenching around that or fixating on “exactly,” it’s just words) and is <em>that</em> good or bad, all of it, the whole of it, local-in-the-context-of-global? (not to inappropriately reify “global”)</p>

<p>Again: just, relative to these different choices, or, loosely speaking, possible worlds, what’s now/then <em>going</em> to happen, and is that outcome, or those outcomes, plural, or this/that unfolding future good? (not to inappropriately reify “future”)</p>

<p>Good and bad are sort of only meaningful relative to local choices and short- and long-run outcomes, and what-could-have-happened-otherwise’s, sort of.</p>

<p>And, then, in light of all of that, “good” and “bad” is a <em>HARD</em> thing to judge, to discern, to evaluate, to predict, to intuit! You could tie yourself in knots, trying! Though, at the same time, we’re doing it all the time, reflectively and unreflectively, through and through. Arguably, it’s a thing you’re not doing at all, or is it, or isn’t it?</p>

<p>To make the point in a different way, there’s a daoist story, where seeming good and bad get reversed, over and over again:</p>

<p>I don’t remember exactly how the story goes, but maybe a farmer loses his most valued horse (bad?), but then the horse comes back, followed by more horses (good?), and maybe the farmer’s son breaks his leg training one of the new horses (bad?), but then the son doesn’t have go fight in a horrific war being waged for questionable reasons (good?), and perhaps the son is still crushingly, devastatingly ashamed for not fighting (bad?), but it engenders in him a thoughtfulness and sensitivity that puts him on the road to wisdom, which is valued by his peers, community, and potential intimate partners (good?)… And then maybe more seeming good and bad follows from that? And so then were all the prior events good or bad? Or both? Or neither? Maybe the story goes something like that.</p>

<p>Anyway, good and bad is sort of blurry, relative, conditional, dependent, interdependent, nebulous, provisional, uncertain. So, not eternal. But also not meaningless: good and bad might still be wholehearted and heartfelt, it’s ok to <em>care</em>, it’s ok for it to <em>matter</em>. But the use of these words isn’t intended to be moralizing and you aren’t being god’s-eye-view judged.</p>

<p>So, yeah, good or bad? It’s hard to know, to tell. I’ve said in other places, sometimes good doesn’t feel (completely) good (or feel good at all) and sometimes bad doesn’t feel (completely) bad (or feel bad at all), or what’s going on is mixed, or uncertain, and so on. (In any case, with respect to “X doesn’t necessarily feel X,” you should still trust yourself, as best you can! This isn’t meant to be undermining! One can only just do their best, as best they can! And it’s enough!)</p>

<p>But, again, you sort of have to judge, discern, evaluate (or you don’t have to at all, truly, just let go, just surrender, too, over and over again). At first this might be a little too “head-y,” a little too intellectual, but it’s really meant to be intuitive, too, whole body, whole everything, felt, the global context of bodymindworldpastpresentfuture [sic]. That is, you sort of have to take into account what happened before, what’s going to happen after, what’s all going on now. The local sort of only makes sense in a global context. “Is/was ‘this’ good or bad or etc.,” is not, generally, a (successfully) myopic question, though sometimes (often?), temporarily, you are just doing the best you can in a locally myopic and narrow vacuum, and that’s ok. That’s part of the process.</p>

<p>Anyway, all that said, sometimes, it’s just sort of too much, at too fine a grain, sometimes too fast (or at least ever-changing, ever-shifting). Like, say you’re doing something, or something happened, or there aren’t any “things” that you can currently pick out of anything, or things keep changing, and then, in all that, of all that… is/was that good or bad?? It’s ok, especially and first, and any time, if you sort of feel like you’re playing continual catch-up, like the river is flowing too fast or slipping through your fingers. It’s ok, any time, to float, to just go with the flow. Things will become clearer and “temporally appropriate bottom-up action” will “rise to meet the right things at the right times”, more and more over time.</p>

<p>And, it’s ok, especially at first, and often, even late-stage, to just not know, over and over again, to be uncertain or to even have no idea whether “something” (perhaps blurry, fuzzy, shimmery, nebulous as it is) is “good” or “bad.” There can be pockets of “reconsidering,” “not knowing,” “unknowing,” sometime really distinctly, sometimes brief and small, sometimes big and lasting for seconds, minutes, hours or days, in the beginning, middle, and lates stages of practice. When you find these pockets, that’s gold–if safe, if it’s the right time, if it’s good to do… hang out with them, keep them company. You may find you’re pressed up against them. And through all that…</p>

<p>Part of it all, is eventually getting to the point of having a real sense of what to do (not to inapproriately reify “real” or “sense”)–and this is through experimenting, learning, watching, waiting, again—letting go, letting things happen. It’s a process. And, the knowledge (loosely speaking, not to inapproriately reify knowledge) that grows, the wisdom, the discernment is local and global, object and meta, specific and general, precise and heuristic, always provisional.</p>

<p>Over time, bit of pieces of the (what’s good and bad [to do, start, stop, maintain, facilitate, gently temporarily prevent, gently temporarily block] sensemaking, can explicated, verbally articulated, sometimes, sometimes even in abstract, general, architechtonic ways–rules, methods, theories, procedures, protocols.</p>

<p>But the real thing-behind-the-thing is implicit, inexplicit, nebulous <em>procedural knowledge</em>, implicit <em>how</em> knowledge. Meditation is more like riding a bike (or driving a car or jogging) than writing an essay or giving a speech. (It’s a very complex, multidimensional bike, to be sure, though ultimately simple on the far side of complexity.) In the end, deep down, you don’t quite know how you’re doing what you’re doing, even as you gently ease towards mastery. Somehow, somehow, the experimenting, the trying, the noticing, the letting go, yes even the thinking!, the figuring!, becomes skill and confidence, over time. In that unknowing and provisionality is simultaneously an unshakeable faith (in the positive sense), an unshakeable trust, in grace, in something, perhaps.</p>

<p>Anyway, especially, what “good” and “bad” mean or don’t mean, to you, will and “should” evolve, over time, as you engage in the practices in this document. Sometimes they will semantically saturate, sometimes, you will realize your conception of something was too narrow, to head-y, not embodied, not em-world-ed, was leaving something out, was maybe not wholehearted and heartfelt and complete and something, as you thought (not that those words or anything have to resonate with you, personally). You  will find errors and misconceptions and mistakes, on your terms, and the meaning of good and bad will change. And sometimes, of course, you’ll go by how things feel and not even be thinking about good and bad, as such, at all, even unreflectively.</p>

<p>In any case, then, good is sort of every-always “seemingly maybe ‘good,’ in the appropriate sense, as far/best as you can currently tell, provisionally, maybe, at least right now,” and bad is sort of ever-always “seemingly maybe ‘bad,’ in the appropriate sense, as far/best as you can currently tell, provisionally, maybe, at least right now,” and/or/also you can reject the ontology, such as: “there is no good and/or bad, there is (just) X [and Y],” where X [and Y] is what works for you.</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>P.S. As far as I can tell, the very immediate and local and situated “doing” of meditation does ultimately harmonize pretty well with explicit ethics, steelmanned golden rules, categorical imperatives, subjunctive and counterfactual coordinative simulations of other agents, timeless decision theories… even if the “joins” are sometimes implicit and nebulous. It’s pretty cool. And, I don’t even really see a contradiction between consequentialism and virtue ethics, either… And so on…</p>

<p>Have you been cranking?</p>

<p>cranking = enacting regular and routine progress; doing the thing</p>

<p>idealized cranking = correct use of the different parts of this document at the correct times, responsively, personally as you concretely work with and through your individual mind</p>

<p>Have you been cranking?</p>

<p>You might also see the “gentle on-ramp”/”onramp” section elsewhere in the document as well as the “meditating by coincidence” section.</p>

<p>Also, some people are turned off by the “crank”/”cranking”/”turning the crank” metaphor. Another way of looking at is with a “learning to play music and playing music” metaphor: The preliminary/auxiliary practices are like playing the scales. The main practices are like playing from sheet music (with personal interpretation). And then after that is improvisation, jazz, riffing, creative, experimental, joyful–maybe “getting somewhere” (cf. “global wayfinding”) and maybe not, depending on how conceived and you proceed, on your terms, but the system is changing and changing, always slowly and sometimes quickly.</p>
