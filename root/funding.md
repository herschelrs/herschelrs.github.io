# (hyper)linking/&#8203;(deep)linking/&#8203;(anchor)linking soft guarantees

Sometimes I revise the anchor links to different sections in the document. When I do this, I preserve old links in the underlying html so that old links, even very old links, should still work. So please "deep link" into the document with (relative) confidence that the links will stay fresh/&#8203;unrotten, for hopefully years and years and years, when citing, sharing sections on blogs, in private chats, etc.
